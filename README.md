# Automatic-Sanitization-Dispenser_IOT

The aim of the project is to design and implement a low cost smart hand sanitizer dispenser
with door controller. It is based on ARDUINO UNO R3 (Micro-controller), temperature sensor
and Ultrasonic Distance sensor (an ultrasonic sensor is used to check the presence of hands below
the outlet of the sanitizer machine), that can be placed and implemented at dierent stations such
as bank doors, school gates, hospital gates etc.
